The iDog plush puppy is a smaller version on the iDog plush although some features have been removed.

The LED lights on the front have been removed and replaced with printed circles that resemble the lights.

The iDog plush puppy also doesn't dance ,as there is no motors inside.

They require no batteries to operate meaning that the output of the speaker is significantly quieter.
