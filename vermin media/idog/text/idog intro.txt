The IDog was an electronic robotic dog manufactured by sega toys in Japan (Later released outside Japan by Hasbro) that was created in the height of the "Ipod frenzy" in 2005 and lasted just 4 years until 2009.

The original Idog would dance (wobble its head from side to side) and play music that was taken from an auxilary input on its hind leg.

Another common feature of the idog series was 7 LED lights that would show the IDogs "emotions" by the colour of the LEDs and the speed at which they flashed.
