The 1st generation of IDog (as seen in the introduction above) has a very ipod-esc aesthetic with clear ears a white face,body and feet with silver accents.

As is standard with most IDogs speaker holes can be found on the back of the above the tail and an aux input located on the left side between the front and back legs.

The IDogs were mostly sturdy with most complaints coming from a weak point in the tail allowing for it to be easily snapped.

this idog model has the most variations as seen in the image to the left.
